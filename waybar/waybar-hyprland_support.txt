i had a similar issue with waybar-hyprland during build.
"error during build exit 4"

basically is caused by gcc and gcc-libs packages.
so downgrade to 12.2.1-4 downloading both packages manually from
https://archive.archlinux.org/

then, cd Downloads
sudo pacman -U gcc-12.2.1-4-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst gcc-libs-12.2.1-4-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst
then, once is downgraded, install
yay -S waybar-hyprland

once installed, update gcc and gcc libs if you want
sudo pacman -S gcc gcc-libs
